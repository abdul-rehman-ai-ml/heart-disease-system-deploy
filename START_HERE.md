# 🚀 START HERE - Your Next Steps

## ✅ What's Already Done

I've created a **complete, production-ready** heart disease prediction system with:

- ✅ **FIXED** your modeling code (using classifiers, not regressors!)
- ✅ Created training script with proper evaluation metrics
- ✅ Built SageMaker-compatible inference handler
- ✅ Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Created testing and cleanup utilities
- ✅ Written comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 What YOU Need to Do Now

### ⏰ Total Time: ~60-90 minutes

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### STEP 1: Train Model Locally (5 min) ⏱️

Open PowerShell/Terminal in your project folder:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Abdul Rehman\OneDrive\Desktop\aiclass\ML_Projects\heart-dicease-system"

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the model
python train_and_save.py
```

**✅ Success Check**: You should see `model.joblib` file created

---

### STEP 2: AWS Account Setup (20 min) ⏱️

#### 2.1 Create AWS Account (if you don't have one)
- Go to: https://aws.amazon.com/
- Click "Create an AWS Account"
- You'll need: Email, Password, Credit Card (free tier available!)

#### 2.2 Create IAM User for GitHub
1. AWS Console → IAM → Users → "Add users"
2. Username: `github-actions-sagemaker`
3. Access type: ✅ "Programmatic access"
4. Permissions: Attach these policies:
   - ✅ `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`
   - ✅ `AmazonS3FullAccess`
5. **SAVE THESE** (you'll need them for GitHub):
   - Access Key ID: `____________________`
   - Secret Access Key: `____________________`

#### 2.3 Create SageMaker Execution Role
1. IAM → Roles → "Create role"
2. Select: "AWS service" → "SageMaker"
3. Permissions: `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` (should be auto-selected)
4. Role name: `SageMakerExecutionRole`
5. **COPY THE ROLE ARN**: `arn:aws:iam::____________:role/SageMakerExecutionRole`

#### 2.4 Create S3 Bucket
```powershell
# Replace with YOUR unique bucket name
aws s3 mb s3://heart-disease-ml-YOUR-NAME-2025 --region us-east-1
```

Or via AWS Console:
- S3 → Create bucket
- Name: `heart-disease-ml-YOUR-NAME-2025` (must be unique!)
- Region: `us-east-1`

**📝 SAVE BUCKET NAME**: `____________________`

---

### STEP 3: GitHub Repository (10 min) ⏱️

#### 3.1 Initialize Git
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Abdul Rehman\OneDrive\Desktop\aiclass\ML_Projects\heart-dicease-system"

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Heart disease ML with SageMaker"
```

#### 3.2 Create GitHub Repo
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `heart-disease-sagemaker`
3. **Don't** initialize with README
4. Click "Create repository"

#### 3.3 Push Code
```powershell
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/heart-disease-sagemaker.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### STEP 4: Configure GitHub Secrets (5 min) ⏱️

1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret" **4 times** for each:

| Click "New repository secret" | Name | Value (from Step 2) |
|-------------------------------|------|---------------------|
| 1st secret | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your access key from 2.2 |
| 2nd secret | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your secret key from 2.2 |
| 3rd secret | `S3_BUCKET` | Your bucket name from 2.4 |
| 4th secret | `SAGEMAKER_ROLE_ARN` | Your role ARN from 2.3 |

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Copy-paste exactly, no extra spaces!

---

### STEP 5: Deploy to SageMaker (15 min) ⏱️

#### Option A: Automatic (Recommended)
```powershell
# Just push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to SageMaker"
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Manual Trigger
1. GitHub repo → "Actions" tab
2. Click "Deploy to SageMaker"
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

#### Monitor Deployment
1. Go to "Actions" tab
2. Click on the running workflow
3. Watch the steps complete (takes ~10-15 min)

**✅ Success Check**: All steps show green checkmarks ✓

---

### STEP 6: Test Your Endpoint (5 min) ⏱️

```powershell
# Test the deployed endpoint
python test_endpoint.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
High Risk Patient:
Prediction: Disease
Risk Score: 87%

Low Risk Patient:
Prediction: No Disease
Risk Score: 23%
```

---

### STEP 7: Cleanup (IMPORTANT!) (2 min) ⏱️

**⚠️ DO THIS TO AVOID AWS CHARGES!**

```powershell
python cleanup.py
```

This deletes:
- ✅ SageMaker endpoint
- ✅ Endpoint configuration
- ✅ Model

---

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Copy this and check off as you go:

```
□ Step 1: Trained model locally (model.joblib created)
□ Step 2: Created AWS account
□ Step 2: Created IAM user (saved credentials)
□ Step 2: Created SageMaker role (saved ARN)
□ Step 2: Created S3 bucket (saved name)
□ Step 3: Created GitHub repository
□ Step 3: Pushed code to GitHub
□ Step 4: Added all 4 GitHub secrets
□ Step 5: Triggered deployment
□ Step 5: Deployment successful (green checkmarks)
□ Step 6: Tested endpoint (got predictions)
□ Step 7: Ran cleanup script
```

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: "Access Denied" error
**Solution**: 
- Double-check GitHub secrets (no typos, no extra spaces)
- Verify IAM user has correct policies

### Problem: Endpoint creation fails
**Solution**:
- Verify SageMaker role ARN is correct
- Check role has `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`

### Problem: Can't find S3 bucket
**Solution**:
- Verify bucket name in GitHub secrets matches exactly
- Check bucket is in `us-east-1` region

### Problem: Import errors locally
**Solution**:
```powershell
pip install --upgrade scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib
```
