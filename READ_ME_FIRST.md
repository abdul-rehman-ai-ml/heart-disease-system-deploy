# ðŸš¨ READ THIS FIRST - Your Deployment is Failing

## What's Wrong?

Your GitHub Actions deployment is failing because the **SageMaker IAM Role ARN** is not configured correctly.

The error message:
```
Value '***' at 'executionRoleArn' failed to satisfy constraint
```

This means your `SAGEMAKER_ROLE_ARN` GitHub secret is either:
- Empty
- Contains a placeholder value
- Has the wrong format
- The IAM role doesn't exist in AWS

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Fix (Choose Your Path)

### Path 1: Quick Fix (5 minutes) âš¡
**For those who want to fix it fast**

ðŸ‘‰ **Open: `QUICK_FIX.md`**

This gives you a 4-step process to:
1. Create the IAM role
2. Update GitHub secret
3. Verify setup
4. Deploy again

---

### Path 2: Detailed Fix (15 minutes) ðŸ“š
**For those who want to understand everything**

ðŸ‘‰ **Open: `FIX_IAM_ROLE_ERROR.md`**

This comprehensive guide includes:
- Root cause analysis
- Step-by-step AWS console instructions
- AWS CLI commands (alternative)
- Troubleshooting for common errors
- Verification checklist
- Additional resources

## ðŸ”§ Verification Tool

Before deploying, run this to check your AWS setup:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Abdul Rehman\OneDrive\Desktop\aiclass\ML_Projects\heart-dicease-system"
python verify_aws_setup.py
```

This script will:
- âœ… Check AWS credentials
- âœ… Verify SageMaker permissions
- âœ… Verify S3 permissions
- âœ… Check if IAM role exists
- âœ… Show you the correct Role ARN to use

---

## ðŸ“‹ What You Need

To fix this, you need:

1. **AWS Account** (free tier is fine)
2. **IAM Role** for SageMaker (you'll create this)
3. **GitHub Repository** with secrets configured

---

## ðŸŽ¯ The Fix in 3 Steps

### 1. Create IAM Role in AWS
- Go to AWS IAM Console
- Create role for SageMaker
- Copy the Role ARN

### 2. Update GitHub Secret
- Go to GitHub repo Settings
- Update `SAGEMAKER_ROLE_ARN` secret
- Paste the Role ARN

### 3. Deploy Again
```powershell
git push origin main
```
